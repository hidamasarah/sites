			<h2>Required skills</h2>
<p>Skillcrush's Web Designer Career Blueprint gave me a strong understanding of wireframing, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery, introduced me to Photoshop, and excersized my ability to manage professional and volunteer duties while enrolled in an educational course. Since the course, I've continued my independent learning by exploring Adobe suite products, including Illustrator,  and implementing CSS3 concepts and Bootstrap. I am looking forward to taking the Wordpress Developer Career Blueprint later this year to complete my skillset.</p>
            
            <h2> The bonus skills you're looking for</h2>
              
            <h7>Teaching</h7> <p>I was as a mentor and tutor in mathematics to high school students for 4 years. I was hired by <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/trioupbound/index.html">Upward Bound</a> and worked from '05-'09 while a full-time college student.</P>
              
             <h7>Working on a remote team</h7><p>I served 1.5 years on the <a href="http://socialmediaclub.org/">Global Board of the Social Media Club</a>, a international association for social media professionals. I worked with board members from a variety of cities in the US, Europe, and Middle East to help manage the chapters growing all over the world. I now currently serve on the Global Membership Committee.</p>
    <h7>Super bonus</h7> <p>While in my Skillcrush course, I helped <a href="https://mightybell.com/communities/skillcrush/members/137415">Sarah S.</a> understand how to use sprites. Still today I'm in touch with Sarah, who is slowly making her way through the web designer course. We met at a Skillcrush Google hangout, where I heard she was from a class a month ahead of me but she was stuck on building her portfolio, a task I had just completed.</p>
